Generally following is the workflow for local git repository.

git init (Use to initialize git in local repo.)
git remote add origin <-links -> (to add remote repo in our local repo.)
git remote -v (to verify remote repo)
git branch (to check branch list)
git branch -M NewBranchName (to rename the branch name)
git push origin main (to push code to remote repo)
git push -u origin main 
(Used to set upstream for origin branch so that we can 
push next time with out writing origin again and again.)
